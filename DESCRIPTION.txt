# Title: Software framework for the processing and statistical analysis of multivariate MS-data

# Description: Performs multivariate data analysis on metabolomics feature matrices, depending on the specified research questions. Depending on the questions proposed in the sampleMetadata, OPLS-DA, PLS, LIMMA and/or PCA models are calculated when possible.
#			   A hyperparameter optimization is included, where the optimal normalization strategy is calculated. For this, information about your groups should be present in ‘Projection1’.
# Input: 
# -	Configuration.R
# -	VariableMetadata.txt
# -	SampleMetadata.txt
# Output: 
# -	In case of hyperparameter optimization: folder param with all plots for each normalization combination, the optimal combination and a table with scores for each normalization combination 
# -	Feature matrices with feature intensities after various steps of normalization/transformation/scaling
# -	Skew-Kurt plots and Shapiro Wilk tests for evaluations of normality distributions of variables
# -	Per pairwise comparison:
#   o	Model plots and parameters (OPLS-DA)
#   o	Tables of significant variables (OPLS-DA)
# -	Per multiple comparison:
#   o	Model plots and parameters (PLS)
#   o	Tables of ranked variables (LIMMA)
# -	Per projection:
#   o	Model plots (PCA)
